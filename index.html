				<p>We are hockey fans asking the National Hockey League to let fans buy authentic, on-ice, Made in Canada jerseys at retail.</p>
			</div>
	
			<h3>What's the problem?</h3>
			<p>The NHL does not sell authentic, North American made, team jerseys to fans at retail. Instead, they sell sweatshop produced replica jerseys and label them as authentic.</p>
	
			<h3>But I just bought an authentic NHL jersey!</h3>
			<p>The "authentic" jerseys currently sold in stores are not the same as the on-ice jerseys. The players 
		wear jerseys made in Canada, from higher quality materials. The fan jerseys sold in stores
		are thinner, lower-quality and made in Indonesia.</p>

			<h3>What about the team-issued and player-worn jerseys that each team sells?</h3>
			<p>Those ARE authentic, on-ice jerseys. They are the real thing, made in Canada. But they
		are usually sold at auction, in very limited supply, are extremely expensive, and they are sized to fit 
		large NHL players who are wearing shoulder pads. They are far too large for most fans to wear.</p>

			<h3>The jerseys they sell now seem fine to me, why should I care?</h3>
			<p>There are plenty of reasons, including:
			<ul>
				<li>The NHL is <strong>misleading</strong> customers by calling these Indonesian-made jerseys "authentic".
		  It's perfectly fine to sell replica jerseys, but they should be labeled and priced accordingly.</li>
				<li>On-ice, pro-stock jerseys are <strong>higher quality</strong>, and provide another choice for fans looking
		  for the highest quality jerseys.</li>
				<li>Pro-stock jerseys are made in Canada. Fans should have the option of a jersey <strong>made in
		  North America</strong>. Right now, the only jerseys offered are made in sweatshops overseas.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
	
			<h3>Why should the NHL do this?</h3>
			<p>Because there is no reason not to. The fans get access to a higher quality product. The
		communities that support the NHL get the economic benefits of having more jerseys manufactured
		locally. The NHL gets more money from the sales of pro-stock jerseys. Everybody wins.</p>

			<h3>But moving manufacturing back onshore is expensive and hard!</h3>
			<p>No! We're not talking about an iPhone here, it's a hockey jersey. And they're <strong>already</strong> making 
		them in Canada! The facilities and processes are already in place, we just want them to make
		<strong>more</strong> of these pro-stock jerseys and and make them available to the fans.</p>

			<h3>Not everyone can afford a top of the line jersey</h3>
			<p>True, and that's perfectly ok. We are not asking them to get rid of replica jerseys. We just want
		the option of a Made in Canada jersey so that fans have a choice.</p>

			<h3>Is it Adidas or the NHL that is responsible?</h3>
			<p>Likely both. However, the NHL has the final say on anything that involves the use of their teams' trademarks. The league
		absolutely has the power to make this happen.</p>
	
			<h3>How can we make this happen?</h3>
			<p>We need to get our message through to the NHL, loudly and clearly. <a href="make_it_happen.html">Here is how we can do that</a>.</p>
